# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Executive Summary
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to define the requirements for the development of the Digital Management System (DMS). The DMS aims to streamline the management of digital assets, improve user accessibility, and enhance operational efficiency. This document outlines the project objectives, key stakeholders, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, assumptions and constraints, and success metrics.

## 2. Project Overview
The Digital Management System (DMS) is designed to centralize the management of digital assets across the organization. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly platform that allows for the efficient storage, retrieval, and management of digital content. The DMS will cater to the needs of various departments, ensuring that all users have access to the resources they require while maintaining security and compliance with industry standards.

### Project Goals
- Develop a centralized platform for digital asset management.
- Enhance user experience through an intuitive interface.
- Ensure data security and compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Provide robust reporting and analytics capabilities.

## 3. Business Objectives
- **Objective 1:** Reduce time spent on asset retrieval by 30% within the first six months of implementation.
- **Objective 2:** Achieve 95% user satisfaction rating through user experience surveys post-deployment.
- **Objective 3:** Ensure 100% compliance with data security regulations by the end of the first year.
- **Objective 4:** Decrease operational costs associated with asset management by 20% within the first year.

## 4. Stakeholders
| Stakeholder | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Project Sponsor | Oversees the project, ensures alignment with strategic goals. |
| Project Manager | Manages project execution, ensures timelines and budgets are met. |
| Business Analyst | Gathers requirements, documents business needs, and facilitates communication among stakeholders. |
| IT Department | Responsible for technical implementation and infrastructure support. |
| End Users | Individuals who will interact with the DMS daily. Their feedback will guide design and functionality. |
| Compliance Officer | Ensures that the system adheres to legal and regulatory standards. |

## 5. Functional Requirements
### 5.1 User Management
- Users must be able to create accounts and manage their profiles.
- Admins must have the ability to assign roles and permissions to users.

### 5.2 Asset Management
- The system must allow users to upload, download, and delete digital assets.
- Users should be able to categorize and tag assets for easy retrieval.

### 5.3 Search Functionality
- The system must provide a robust search feature that allows users to filter results by category, tag, and metadata.

### 5.4 Reporting and Analytics
- The system must generate reports on asset usage, user activity, and compliance metrics.

### 5.5 Security Features
- The system must implement role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive information.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The system must handle up to 500 concurrent users without degradation of performance.
- **Scalability:** The architecture should allow for easy scaling to accommodate future growth.
- **Security:** Data encryption must be implemented for sensitive information both in transit and at rest.
- **Usability:** The interface should adhere to usability standards, ensuring that all users can navigate the system with minimal training.

## 7. User Stories
- **User Story 1:** As an admin, I want to manage user accounts so that I can control access to the system.
- **User Story 2:** As an end user, I want to upload and tag my digital assets so that they are easy to find later.
- **User Story 3:** As a compliance officer, I want to generate reports on asset use so that I can ensure regulatory compliance.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- All functional requirements must be tested and validated through user acceptance testing (UAT).
- Security features must pass an independent security audit.
- User satisfaction must be measured and reported through surveys post-implementation.

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints
- **Assumption:** Users will have basic digital literacy and familiarity with digital asset management concepts.
- **Constraint:** The project must be completed within the allocated budget and timeline.

## 10. Success Metrics
- User adoption rates measured by the number of active users within the first three months.
- The percentage reduction in asset retrieval time as reported by users.
- Compliance audit results demonstrating adherence to data security regulations.
- User feedback scores collected through regular surveys.
